== Description ==

The Quickdashboard gives the finishing touches to each of your WordPress projects and ensures a smooth transfer to your customer. The training in WordPress is drastically shortened and the user quickly finds his way around his new website. The Quickdashboard replaces the standard WordPress backend with a new, clearly arranged dashboard. All users with the role "Quickboard" see this custom dashboard after login. All regular admin menu items are hidden. The idea is that a certain group of users has direct access to pages/options of the WP-Admin, which are set with this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'quickdashboard.zip' through Wordpress 'Plugins' installation menu
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why having a custom dashboard? =

It helps user that are not familiar with Wordpress to work in admin area.
They only can directly access the pages / options they have to and not get confused
by lots of links in the menu.

= Does it work with any menu item? =

Yes and no. Yes you can set a button-link, but in some cases, when for example a plugin got own 
roles or capabilities, the access to that linked page / option is not granted and Wordpress will shown 
an error 'Sorry, you are not allowed to access this page.'.
This applies mostly for SEO plugins.

= How does Quickdashboard help me as a web designer with a new WordPress website for my client? =

From our experience from over 20 years of web design we know that a customer with a great website is frustrated in no time because WordPress is too much for him. Countless trainings do not help because WordPress lacks an intuitive handling. First of all it is important to know what purpose the new WordPress website should serve. Furthermore it is important to know how well your customer already knows WordPress. Depending on the level of knowledge, you will definitely help him to learn how to use his new WordPress website much faster with Quickdashboard. With Quickdashboard you can let your customer get started with WordPress already in the development phase with his own account! He can then immediately familiarize himself with the functions for which the website is being built.

= Does Quickdashboard also work for mobile? =

Yes, Quickdashboard is mobile ready. The handling is possible by touch as well as by pen.
